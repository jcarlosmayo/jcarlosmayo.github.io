Following the previous [post](http://factsandfigures.me/regular-expressions-to-categorize-data/) in which I created nine categories to explore the extreme weather events recorded by the <a target="_blank" href"www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> in the US. I focused on the questions posed by the <a target="_blank" href="www.coursera.org/course/repdata">Reproducible Research course</a>. Across the United States:

* Which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

* Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?


####Most harmful to population health

Tornados are by far the most damaging weather event in the US. 60,700 tornados were registered from 1950 until 2011, injuring 91,407 and killing 5,636. 65% of all injuries caused by weather events are the result of tornados, while the next major cause of injuries, rain, represents only 10%. In terms of fatalities, however, tornados represent 37.2% of deaths, followed by 22% caused by hot weather, including draught.

####Economic consequences

Floods have caused the major economic losses from 1950 to 2011. In that period 86,136 floods have been reported and while they have caused damages in the crops valued in 7,4 billion dollars, the result in property damages reaches 167 billion dollars.

####Weather evolution
The record is only complete for all weather events from 1993 onwards. In those years the most significant is the rapid increase in the number of thunderstorms, although floods also display some increase and interestingly there is an abrupt leap in cold weather in recent years. The large increase of "other" events may be a result of the categorization established in the [data cleaning process](http://factsandfigures.me/regular-expressions-to-categorize-data/) but it may also reflect the fact that many more minute appreciations have been recorded in recent years, such as ""red flag criteria", "remnants of floyd" or "waterspout funnel cloud", which, in turn, make it very difficult to categorize the data.
