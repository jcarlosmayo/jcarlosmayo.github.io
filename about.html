<p>I hold a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licentiate#Spain">licenciate degree</a> in business management and administration, a master degree in international business and a MBA in international trade and management. I took my first programming course ever at age 29 thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1">Coursera</a> and I haven't stopped since then. I have focused mostly on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and I enjoy using it to perform all sorts of data analysis tasks. Along the way I have also gained some web development experience which prompted me to create this site as a companion to my learning process.</p>

<p>I love to explore new things. I am curious about most of the stuff I bump into and I try to be resourceful enough to learn as much as possible about it. I also love to carry my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jcarlosmayo/">camera around</a>, music, rock climbing and jogging under heavy weather.</p>
